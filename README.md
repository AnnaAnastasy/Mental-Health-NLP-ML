## Sentiment Analysis for Mental Health using NLP and ML

Mental health is a critical aspect of overall well-being, and understanding the nuances of mental health conditions can be a powerful tool in providing timely support and interventions. In this project, we perform sentiment analysis on textual data to predict the mental health status of individuals based on their statements. By analyzing the language used in these statements, we aim to accurately classify them into one of seven mental health categories: Normal, Depression, Suicidal, Anxiety, Stress, Bi-Polar, and Personality Disorder.

By applying advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models, we seek to classify these statements accurately. The insights from this analysis could help mental health professionals in early identification and intervention.
